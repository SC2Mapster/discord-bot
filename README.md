# SC2Mapster Discord Bot

Made to operate on SC2Mapster server exclusively, it is however possible that it might become multi-server bot, if its feature pool grows enough to be useful outside of it. *(I have some long-term ideas...)*

Current version: `pre-pre-alpha`

The [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando) framework I started with doesn't play well with Typescript, also it doesn't provide friendly way of handling subcommands. 

Instead it adds some overhead by enforcing features that are not useful - such as per guild settings/permissions, dynamic loading/unloading commmands, etc. What in the end makes the code more complex than it needs to be.

Thus before adding more functionalities, I'll probably try to either get rid of the framework, or use only subset of its functions.
