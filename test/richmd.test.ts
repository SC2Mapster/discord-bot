# Star Party 2.0!

Star Party is back on track with a big update. It has 3 new minigames, a new board, old minigames revamp and more. All old bugs are fixed. For those who doesn't know what is Star Party, in short, it's a Mario Party game in SC2 with its own twists. It is super fun, you laugh, you cry, you smile, you pass a nice moment.

Star Party won the Rock The Cabinet contest back in 2014. You can [watch the winners announcement by Blizzard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GxLuyuWEN4).

NB: The map is uploaded under a different name than the original. It used to be "Star Party [RTC]". It is now named **Star Party 2.0**. It has been uploaded to all regions as well.
